**As long as you're alive, anything is possible**
There is only one good reason why a person can give up. This is death. So, as long as you are alive, you must go to your goal.
**Be realists**
I don't think you can do it all the first time. You are going to make a lot of mistakes, but don't forget to learn from them.
**You're strong**
Man is much stronger than he thinks. Including you. Nothing can stop you from succeeding. Even thousands of defeats.
**Prove themselves**
Show the world what you can do. You will only fail when you give up.
**Has this been done before?**
If someone else could do it, you can, too. Even if such a person is the only one in the world. This is possible, period.
**Believe in your dreams**
Never betray yourself for anything. No one can control your destiny but you. If you don't believe in yourself, no one will do it for you.
**Your family and friends**
Let your loved ones be your inspiration on the way to success. Never give up, because you have them.
**There are people in a worse position than you**
There are many people in the world who are in a worse situation right now than you are. If you want to give up your morning run, think about people who can't walk at all.
**Improve our world**
When you do succeed, don't forget to take care of our planet and the people around you.
**You deserve to be happy**
If you say this to yourself always, no one can stand in your way to success.
**Inspire others**
When you achieve success or are still on your way to it, help other people deal with their problems. You know as well as anyone how hard the road to victory is.
**You're so close**
The darkest hour before dawn. If you feel that you don't have the strength to go any further, then you are just a hair's breadth away from success.
